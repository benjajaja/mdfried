# Markdown Fried!

You can cook a terminal. Can you **deep fry** a terminal?
_YES!_ You can have **cooked _and_ fried** widgets!
~Is this insane?~

Another paragraph now, which should get wrapped without breaking up words, nor whitespace at the beginning of lines. This is very primitive and fragile, for example, what happens with multi-width characters? Yes, they will probably cause havoc. It's impossible to know how wide a character will be in the terminal.

### Unwrapped looooong paragraph:

In a world shrouded in darkness and flame, the universe of Dark Souls begins with the Age of Ancients, a time of gray crags, archtrees, and everlasting dragons, where nothing changed and life as we know it did not yet exist. From the dark abyss, a primordial fire—the First Flame—burst into existence, bringing with it the dichotomies of light and dark, heat and cold, life and death. In the flame's heart, powerful souls emerged, claimed by beings who would shape the fate of the world: Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight; the Witch of Izalith; Nito, the First of the Dead; and the Furtive Pygmy, who is largely forgotten but gives humanity its dark soul. Gwyn and his allies waged war against the dragons, using lightning bolts to shatter their scales, the Witch's pyromancies to raze their domains, and Nito’s miasma of death to rot their immortal forms. The war ended with the rise of the Age of Fire, as Gwyn’s dominion spread over the land and civilization flourished under his rule. However, fire is transient, and as the First Flame began to fade, humanity’s darkness stirred. The Undead Curse appeared, marking people with the Darksign, trapping them in a cycle of death and resurrection that slowly eroded their sanity. In desperation, Gwyn sought to prolong the Age of Fire by sacrificing himself to rekindle the flame, becoming a hollow shell of his former self, a god reduced to a smoldering cinder. The world began to crumble into decay, with kingdoms rising and falling like leaves in the wind, each trying and failing to resist the inevitable dark. The player, a cursed Undead, awakens in a world on the brink of collapse, journeying through shattered lands filled with remnants of past glories, grotesque creatures, and tragic figures whose ambitions and hubris led to their ruin. Along the way, the player faces impossible choices: to link the fire and perpetuate the cycle, embracing the flame’s tyranny, or to usher in the Age of Dark, allowing humanity’s true nature to take hold. These choices echo the eternal struggle between light and dark, a dance of entropy and renewal in a universe indifferent to the suffering of its inhabitants.

THE END
